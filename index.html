      Welcome to your Be a Developer at Primate Exercise.
      
      Please fork this project so you can work on your own version.
      ---
      
      This exercise will give you an idea of the type of work we do at Primate on a daily basis.

      The exercise consists of two tasks:
      1. Building the Card component (HTML and CSS).
      2. Creating a responsive Listing of 5 or 6 Cards that changes its look depending on the screen size (HTML and CSS).

      The attached iframe is a reference to a mock-up of how the cards should look like in both versions: vertical (mobile) and horizontal (desktop). 

      The list should behave so you can see:
      - two horizontal (desktop) cards in a row on a 'large' screen
      - two vertical (mobile) cards in one row on a 'medium' screen
      - one horizontal (desktop) card on a 'small' screen
      - one vertical (mobile) card for evertyhing smaller than that
      (you probably want to build mobile first so work through this list from bottom to top)

      You should be able to achieve it using flexbox but we're open to other ideas.
      For images you can use anything you want, we would recommend: https://source.unsplash.com/.

      Optional, if you're brave:
      - you can add some hover animation to the Button
      
      Most of the CSS for Card is set up in the style.css file, but you need to come up with the breakpoints for Listing and of course create the HTML structure for the Card.
      We care deeply about the valid and semantic HTML, so make sure the tags you are using make sense.

      Spend as much time on it as you wish, but we don't expect you to take more than 2h. Most likely you won't have time to do everything in this timeframe, that's absolutely OK too. The most important is staying on the right track and focusing on what's important.

      If you want to leave us some comments about this task, explain your decisions, tell us what you enjoyed or hated, please use the HTML comments in one of the files.

      As final submission, please email a link to your own project fork to jobs@primate.co.uk and include your name somewhere.

      We would normally do this exercise in our office and in person but times are different now, so hopefully we'll see you on video chat soon.

      Thank you again for taking time to do this exercise, we really appreciate it.

      ---
      Good luck and ...
      ~ happy coding
